Tic Tac Toe
Aim

To implement a Tic Tac Toe game in Python where a human can play against the computer, and the computer uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.

Theory

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3×3 grid.
Each player takes turns marking a square (X or O), and the first to get three in a row wins.

The Minimax algorithm is used to make the AI unbeatable.
It simulates all possible moves and their outcomes, assuming both players play optimally.

Algorithm Steps

Represent the board as a 3×3 matrix or a list of 9 cells.

Check if the current state is terminal (win, lose, or tie).

For each possible move:

Simulate the move.

Call the Minimax function recursively for the opponent.

Assign a score:

+1 for a win,

-1 for a loss,

0 for a draw.

Choose the move that maximizes the score for the AI.

Features

✅ Human vs AI gameplay
✅ AI always plays optimally
✅ Board displayed after every move
✅ Detects win, loss, or tie
